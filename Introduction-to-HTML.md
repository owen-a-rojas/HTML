# What's HTML?

***HTML, or HyperText Markup Language,*** is the standard markup language used to create and design documents on the World Wide Web. It's the basic building block of web development and is essential for creating the structure of web pages. HTML provides a way to structure content, such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, images, and other elements.

## What's HTML used for?

+ ***Creating Web Pages:*** HTML is the foundational language for building web pages. It allows you to define the structure of a webpage by organizing content into various elements like headings, paragraphs, lists, images, links, and more.

+ ***Hyperlinking:*** HTML enables the creation of hyperlinks, which are clickable elements that allow users to navigate between different web pages. Links are created using the ```<a>``` (anchor) element.

+ ***Document Structure:*** HTML provides a hierarchical structure to web documents, using elements like ```<head>``` for metadata, ```<body>``` for the main content, and various other elements for headings, paragraphs, and lists.

+ ***Semantic Markup:*** HTML includes semantic elements that convey meaning about the content. For example, ```<header>,``` ```<nav>,``` ```<article>,``` ```<section>,``` ```<footer>,``` etc., provide semantic information about the purpose of different parts of the webpage.

+ ***Forms:*** HTML includes form elements (such as ```<form>,``` ```<input>,``` ```<select>,``` ```<textarea>```) that allow users to input data. Forms are often used for user interactions, like submitting data or conducting searches.

+ ***Multimedia Integration:*** HTML supports embedding multimedia elements such as images ```(<img>),``` audio ```(<audio>),``` and video ```(<video>).```

+ ***Accessibility:*** HTML includes features that contribute to web accessibility, such as alternative text for images ```(alt attribute),``` which is important for users with visual impairments using screen readers.

+ ***Compatibility with CSS and JavaScript:*** HTML is often used in conjunction with CSS ```(Cascading Style Sheets)``` for styling and layout, and JavaScript for adding interactivity and dynamic behavior to web pages.

+ ***Responsive Web Design:*** HTML, along with CSS, is crucial for creating responsive web designs that adapt to different screen sizes and devices.
